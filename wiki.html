        <h3>Welcome to Bread Clicker!</h3>
        <p>Create your bread empire by making dough!
        How do you do this, you may ask? Well, just click on the bread in the
        middle to start making dough. Click. Click some more. Tired, aren't
        you? Have some help! Either upgrade your bread, buy spreads, or get
        an upgrade. Let's explore your options.</p>
        <h3>Buy Breads</h3>
        	<p>Up your game with a two-in-one package along with a shiny new look
            to your bread! It increases your DPS, or Dough Per Second. It will
            also increase your DPC, or Dough Per Click. Very simple stuff.
          </p>
        <h3>Buy Spreads</h3>
           <p>Increase your DPS by filling your collection with sweet and savory
            spreads! These make every other DPS purchase a little more valuable.
          </p>
        <h3>Buy Upgrades</h3>
          <p>Increase your DPS by having bread being made for you! You can
            purchase appliances, people, businesses, and plots of land to increase
            your DPS earnings. Upgrades can be bought multiple times as well! The
            only limit is how much money you have.
        	</p>
        <h3>Buy Backgrounds</h3>
          <p>Background info is coming soon!</p>
